# computer-science

My attempt at completing https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science. I've considered going back to school for a CS degree but the money does not agree with me. So here I am trying to complete these courses on my own time! Wish me luck and [join me](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science.)!
