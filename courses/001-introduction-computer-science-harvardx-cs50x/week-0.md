## Binary
In the decimal system there are ones, tens, hundreds, etc. In binary, there are ones, twos, fours, etc.

An easy way to figure out what a number is in binary is to create a chart like this:

32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1

1. If your number is smaller than a number in the chart, mark a 1 above it.
2. Subtract the number in chart from your original number.
3. Take your result and repeat steps 1 and 2 until you reach 0.
4. Fill in the empty space in the chart with 0s.
